    "## Concepts \n",
    "The Descartes Labs Catalog is a repository for georeferenced images. Commonly these images are either acquired by Earth observation platforms like a satellite or they are derived from other georeferenced images. The catalog is modeled on the following core concepts, each of which is represented by its own class in the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "An image (represented by class `Image` in the API) contains data for a shape on earth, as specified by its georeferencing. An image references one or more files (commonly TIFF or JPEG files) that contain the binary data conforming to the band declaration of its product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bands\n",
    "A band (represented by class `Band`) is a 2-dimensional slice of raster data in an image. A product must have at least one band and all images in the product must conform to the declared band structure. For example, an optical sensor will commonly have bands that correspond to the red, blue and green visible light spectrum, which you could raster together to create an RGB image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Products\n",
    "A product (represented by class `Product`) is a collection of images that share the same band structure. Images in a product can generally be used jointly in a data analysis, as they are expected to have been uniformly processed with respect to data correction, georegistration and so on. For example, you can composite multiple images from a product to run an algorithm over a large geographic region."
